# Bakery

This is a collection of [BakeJS](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/bake-js) recipes.  You can help make JS applications "bakeable" by forking this repo and adding new recipes for common JS libraries.

Have a read of the [documentation](http://bakejs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/writing-recipes.html) and get started :)
